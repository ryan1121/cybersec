# I am Samuel Morse!

[toc]

## Description
Found a typewriter in Kuki Godam's place with a message with dashes and dots. Kindly help us to decode it!

Flag format: SKR{flag_flag}

## Solution
From the title of challenge and the image provided, we should know that this is a challenge about Morse's Code.
The [morse.jpg](./morse.jpg) is showing a series of morse code :
```
.. ...- . / --. --- -. . / .-- .... . -. / ..- / ... . . / - .... .. ...
```
We can either one by one compared to the Morse Code, or using the online [Morde Decoder](https://morsecoder.org/morse-code-decoder) to decode it.

Morse Code with current standard :

Then we got the flag's content :
```
IVE GONE WHEN U SEE THIS
```

## Flag
```
SKR{IVE GONE WHEN U SEE THIS}
```
