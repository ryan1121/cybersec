Description
This garden contains more than it seems.

## Solution
There appears to be something in the image. Let's use **strings** command to get the strings inside the image
```
strings garden.jpg
```

We found the flag on the last line :
```
Here is a flag "picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3eBdBd2cc}"
```

## Flag
```
picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y3eBdBd2cc}
```
